# rotom-bot
Extremely simple discord bot written in python for a private discord, still a WIP as I figure out what to add to it

Can detect pokemon-showdown replays in chats and automatically print the score as a message

Also can return a list of names with a certain role (usage: $rolelist [name of role])

$mhbio [insert mhw creature here] now returns info on that creature

Built in Python3, untested in lower versions. 

Use:
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
to get pre-requisites
